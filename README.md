# MongoDB Query Bug: Incorrect Use of $in Operator

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB queries involving the `$in` operator.  The `$in` operator is intended to check if a field's value exists within a specified array.  However, it is frequently misused, leading to unexpected query results.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect usage, where the `$in` operator is incorrectly applied to a single field when multiple criteria are required. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the correct approach using the `$or` operator or other appropriate querying techniques.

## Bug Description:
Incorrect use of `$in` operator in MongoDB query.  Incorrect implementation can lead to unintended results. 

## How to Reproduce the Bug:
Run `bug.js`. The results will be unexpected and demonstrate the incorrect behavior. 

## Solution
The solution is found in `bugSolution.js` and involves using the `$or` operator to correctly query for multiple values across the same field.
